AI Web
======

A framework for running AI programming challenges
-------------------------------------------------

Still under active development.

 - Set up passwordless SSH authentication for all machines. Also allow it from localhost to localhost, even when running a standalone server on a single machine.

 - Run all of the following:

   $ ./manage.py runserver
   $ ./manage.py webserver_backend
   $ ./manage.py run_matchmaker
   $ ./manage.py run_worker

 - See the requirements of the Isolate submodule if you have trouble running games.

 - Much of the system is untested and incomplete. There will be bugs.

 - Code has been taken from Zeta, Epsilon, the TCP server code and other places.
